Hi, I am Chaitanya, I am an engineer at heart and have had since childhood an interest in electronics and computer software. My desire to create and know more is what made me pursue a graduate degree in computer engineering at NC State University.

My first full-time job was at Nagarro, where I worked as a software engineer for four years. Working at Nagarro was demanding and fun. I delivered quality work on time and have learned a lot about Agile processes, design patterns, and standards followed while developing code.

At NC State, I have gained a good understanding of computer architecture, embedded systems, and compilers. I have worked on projects that include:
1. Building C++ simulators to model and study computer architectures.
2. Developing compiler frontend and optimization pass using LLVM.
3. Scheduling tasks with hard real time requirements on embedded systems with and without RTOS.
4. Sharing resources on system running RTOS.
5. Optimizing embedded systems for speed, responsiveness and memory.
6. Projects involving use of UART, IÂ²C, SPI and USB, some of which can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/chaitanyamehta) profile.

I am quick at learning new concepts and possess the ability to work in a team.
